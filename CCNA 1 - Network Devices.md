# CCNA 1 - Network Devices:

- Network: A computer network is a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources.
- Clients: device that accesses a service made available by a server
- Service: device that provides functions or services for clients. The same device can be a client in some situations, and a server in other situations.
- Switches:
  - have many network interfaces/ports for end hosts to connect to (24+)
  - provide conectivity to hosts within the same LAN
  - do not provide connectivity between LANs/over the internet
<!-- TODO IMG -->
- Routers: 
  - have fewer network interfaces
  - are used to provide connectivity between LANs
  - are therefore used to send data over the internet

- Firewalls:
  - monitor and controll network traffic based on configured rules
  - can be placed 'inside' the network, or 'outside' the network
  - are known as 'Next-Generation Firewalls' when they include more modern and advanced filtering capabilities
- Network Firewalls: hardware that filters traffic between networks
- Host-based Firewalls: software applications that filters traffic entering and exiting a host machine, like a PC
